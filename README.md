# react starter

A quick starter repo with the basics: react, redux, webpack, immutable, and webpack dev server

Get up and running with all of these pieces in tact. Dependencies should be installed locally so feel free to just run npm install and continue with whatever scripts you like.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
